You will be implementing the following function:

```
void prune(MaxHeap& heap, int m)
```

Given a `MaxHeap` (see `MaxHeap.h`) and an integer `m`, write a function that
prunes/removes all elements in the heap that are less than `m`. Remember that
if a node `n` in the heap has value less than `m`, than all of `n`'s children
also have values less than `m`.

Example 1:
```
Heap: [+inf, 11,9,7,5,3,1]
Input: m = 6
Heap before pruning:
     11
    /   \
   9     7
  / \   /
 5   3 1

Heap after pruning:
   11
  /   \
 9     7
```

Example 2:
```
Heap: [+inf, 9,5,8,3,1]
Input: m = 7
Heap before pruning:
      9
    /   \
   5     8
  / \
 3   1

Heap after pruning:
   9
  /
 8
```
